## Problem Statement
- Vendor "Manage Ticket" links enabled unauthorized rescheduling
- Fraudsters moved future bookings (30/12→28/12) + redeemed tickets
- 74% hit rate (26/35 bookings affected on 31/12 alone)
- Cross-functional investigation (RO, CO, Fraud, Legal teams)

## Solution Implementation
- Vendor switch: GT → BMG (non-cancellable tickets)
- Delayed fulfillment (6-9PM workflow post-USS hours)
- Self-rescheduling via "Manage Ticket" (prevents fraud)
- address investigation (Legal escalation, resolution done)
- Google Sheets tracking (150+ bookings monitored)
